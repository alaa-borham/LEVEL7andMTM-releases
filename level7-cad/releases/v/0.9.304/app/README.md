LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.304

LEVEL7 MTM can use this program in place of GRAFIS. A customer's pattern may be a LEVEL7 and MTM design (.level7); LEVEL7 MTM then sends each order to the program, with no window, no robot and no person drawing:
"LEVEL7 and MTM.exe" --cli --model <design.level7> --order <order.json> --out <folder>
In about a second it makes the pieces of every part the order makes (the parts its design options choose, with their copies, mirrored copies and material; otherwise every production part of the design, not only the part open when it was saved), in the customer's measurements. It writes one DXF-AAMA, which LEVEL7 Nesting nests, and the order's report (<order>_<customer>.json). The admin's control applies as when the program opens: the program's files must be approved, a user must be remembered on that computer (signed in once with «تذكرني»), and the user must be allowed in LEVEL7 and MTM and on that computer. Otherwise the order is refused (exit 4, and level7-report.json says why). The program needs to be downloaded in full (its sealed core changed).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.303

The admin can close this whole program for a user: «LEVEL7 and MTM» unticked under «البرامج المسموحة له» in LEVEL7 CAD MTM Admin 1.2.3 (LEVEL7 Nesting and LEVEL7 MTM are closed the same way, from the same policy). The user then sees the locked screen with «هذا البرنامج مغلق على هذا المستخدم» and can sign in as another user.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.302

The tool icons on a very light grey tile (the user's choice from five shown): as clear as white, calmer beside the black drawing. The ten transformation tools carry the icons the user drew (mirror copy / move, mirror by two points, by a point and a direction, rotate, dart close / move, slash and spread, scale from a point, stretch in a direction, dart), and the transformations group its own fixed picture (transformGroup.png). The edit tools too: set a line's length, cut / extend to a line; and the four point tools (free point, point on a line, intersection, point moved along a line). The points and edit groups get their own fixed pictures too.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.301

The tool icons on a clean white tile instead of the linen texture, a little larger, so their details are clear: the tools strip, the group menus and the step card.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.300

The line tools carry the icons the user drew: line between two points, line by length and angle, parallel line, parallel to several lines and curves (assets/icons/*.png); the lines group keeps its own fixed picture (lineGroup.png), whichever line tool was used. The program's core is unchanged: the first release that reaches the computers as an automatic update.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.299

The full program of every approved release is built in the public releases repository and put on its Releases page (github.com/alaa-borham/LEVEL7andMTM-releases/releases): one fixed address to download it, nothing kept in the private repository's limited storage. Each file is obfuscated the same way in every release, so a release that does not change the sealed core reaches the computers as an automatic update. A release that does change it says so («يحتاج البرنامج الكامل · انقر للتنزيل») and a click opens that page (it used to say only «تعذر الفحص»); «waiting for the admin's approval» is shown as such.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.298

A start screen (the program's icon) covers everything from the first paint until the design is ready: no half-built screens while it loads. A second copy of the program only brings the open one forward (it used to show «could not start: ERR_FAILED»).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.297

The admin's new key built in (the first key's pass phrase was lost). The computers on 0.9.294 accept only what the old key signed: they are installed again by hand with this version (once). LEVEL7 CAD MTM Admin 1.2.0 carries the same key.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.296

The program's new icon (the LEVEL7 CAD glass icon with the jacket pattern): the window, the taskbar, the shortcuts (assets/icon.ico, icon.png) and the built exe. The shortcuts' icon is taken from the pages' folder (in the sealed program the app path is inside app.asar, which Windows cannot read).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.295

The super admin left the design program: no menu, no screen, no admin functions in it (not even on the lock screen). The admin works in his own program, «LEVEL7 CAD MTM Admin» (level7-cad/admin-app, built by build-admin-windows.sh): users as cards, one button to publish, one button to approve a release (which also offers it to the computers). Releases are prepared in their own folder (tools/stage-release.mjs) and reach the computers only when the admin approves them.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.294

The admin's public key (LEVEL7) is built in: the super admin control is ON in the built program. Each copy needs the admin's signed users' policy (login with name and password) and the admin's approval of its version before it works.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.293

The Windows program is sealed (level7-cad/tools/seal-windows.mjs, in build-windows.sh): the main process (licence, updates, file check) runs only from resources/app.asar, whose fingerprint is in the exe — one changed byte and it does not start; running the exe as plain Node, NODE_OPTIONS and the debugger flags are closed. The pages stay beside it and are updated as before; a release that changes the main process needs the new program (Setup). Checked on a real Windows machine by the build workflow (job level7-and-mtm-windows-check).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.292

The program goes to the computers obfuscated (level7-cad/tools/obfuscate-app.mjs): names and strings unreadable everywhere, the main process (licence, updates) with its control flow scrambled too. Releases, the users' policy and the approvals are read first from the public repository alaa-borham/LEVEL7andMTM-releases (the source repository becomes private), then from the source repository during the move; the super admin screen publishes to it.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.291

Super admin: releases approved by the admin. With the control on, the program checks at start that every one of its files is as in the list the admin approved for its version (a file changed by hand: it does not run, the file named), and an update installs only when the admin approved exactly that release («بانتظار موافقة المدير» until then). Super admin → «اعتماد الإصدارات»; the lock screen opens super admin too (everything there needs the admin's key).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.290

Super admin: users bound to devices. Each computer has a code (ABCDE-FGHJK) made from the operating system's machine id, shown on the login screen; a user given devices in the super admin screen works only on those (copying the program or its data to another computer does not carry the permission). Empty = any device.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.289

Super admin control (Extras → «سوبر أدمن…»): users with a name and a password; per user the last working day, the tools / commands closed to them (hidden and refused, also by the drawing engine) and whether they may change the X / Z tables. The admin signs the policy with a private key (Ed25519, a file with a pass phrase, never leaves the admin's computer) and publishes it with the updates; every copy verifies it with the public key built into the program, keeps the last one and works offline until the user's date. Off until the admin's public key is built in.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.288

LEVEL7 design (Inheritance): «قوالب الثوب الجاهزة» — front with jabzour, back, sleeve, jabzour strip, stand collar (sadaa), turn-down collar (gallab), cuff (kabk), side pocket, chest pocket. Each is inserted as a new part; its X are matched by name (or MTM code) to the design's X table, the missing ones added with a standard value, its Z added once.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.287

LEVEL7 design (Transforms): «بنسة على خط» (a dart: its middle by a distance on the line, its tip, its width — X/Z), «تدوير حول نقطة بزاوية», «تدوير من نقطة إلى نقطة (قفل البنسة)» and «قص وفتح (Slash & Spread)» (opened by mm measured at a point); each a step that follows the sizes, copy or move.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.286

LEVEL7 design: seam walking (seam check bar → «تمشية الخياطة»): seam 2 walked along seam 1 by the share of the length (the ease spread) or the same distance; the start of each seam chosen (an armhole from the underarm); matching notches added on both seams at once, or copied from one to the other (on another part too: one undo step in that part's history). The seam check bar wraps instead of overlapping.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.285

LEVEL7 design: the marker for several sizes — a ratio per size (0 leaves it out), plies and the ends allowance; the spreading plan (fabric, garments per size, per garment). Kept in the design.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.284

LEVEL7 design: Export → «طباعة الباترون 1:1 على ورق A4 (PDF)»: the pieces at true size on A4 pages (A1, A2 …, crosses and neighbours to tape them), a map page with a 10 cm square; pieces on the fold printed as halves.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.283

LEVEL7 design: each piece in the plotter files (export PLT and the marker's cut file) carries a label: style, part number, how many, size, order number (Product info «رقم الطلب»).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.282

LEVEL7 design: production check before the marker (every production part, and saved seams in every size: length difference within the allowed range, notches matching); the seam length check saves a pair («حفظ للفحص»).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.281

LEVEL7 design: «Seam length check» (as GRAFIS): two groups of lines from any parts (e.g. armholes / sleeve cap), their totals and the difference.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.280

LEVEL7 design: the X / Z list beside a value field opens as a clear list — code, value and name in columns, larger, with a search — instead of the system drop-down.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.279

LEVEL7 design: «Parts» (the part list window) moved from the bar into the View menu (Ctrl+T unchanged; also the parts strip's list button).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.278

LEVEL7 design: zoom − / + moved from the bar into the View menu (Zoom in / Zoom out; the keys − / + unchanged).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.277

LEVEL7 design: the parts strip's head as GRAFIS — drawn icons (List hidden parts, Open new part, part list, Show / Hide all parts, «…» kinds of part: draft, production, stitch, mother, daughter, by fabric; strip mode).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.276

LEVEL7 design: «Link chain» around a closed outline stops where it closes; a line going off there (a centre line) is not taken into it.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.275

LEVEL7 design: each part's undo history survives closing the program — also after a parts operation that renumbers parts, and when the program is closed right after the last change.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.274

LEVEL7 design: corner tools as GRAFIS: each line is clicked on the part that stays (a line crossing past the corner loses its other part); the guide shows it.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.273

LEVEL7 design: «Link» joins two lines that cross just by their ends (a half that runs a little past the centre line and its mirrored half) at the crossing.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.272

LEVEL7 design: «Trim / extend to a line» picks the base line first, then the part to cut (as GRAFIS); the base line stays chosen for the next cut.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.271

LEVEL7 design: «Line by angle and length» can end by itself on the first line it meets («ينتهي: عند أول تقاطع»), and follows that line; the choice is remembered.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.270

LEVEL7 design: corner tools (sharp, round, chamfer) show a guide as GRAFIS: red dots on the line ends and the corner, a dashed arrow / dashed lines to the corner.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.269

LEVEL7 design: «Point on line» follows the mouse past either end of the line (its extension), not stopping at the ends.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.268

LEVEL7 design: the marker picture zooms with the wheel, moves with a drag, double-click shows it whole; zoomed in, a notch shows at its real length.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.267

LEVEL7 design: the notch marks on the marker preview are half the size (a short tick, thinner).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.266

LEVEL7 design: notches shown (red) on the laid marker; a second notch on the same place of a piece is refused.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.265

LEVEL7 design: the marker lays the pieces by the grain line drawn in the part (not by the pieces' grain value, 90 by default); a mirrored copy takes it mirrored.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.264

LEVEL7 design: the grain line tool shows no values window either: the direction follows the mouse, a click draws it (50 mm); double-click it to change its values.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.263

LEVEL7 design: the grain line tool shows no point panel; its start is just clicked in the piece.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.262

LEVEL7 design: deleting a line that a curve's end angle is measured from keeps the curve (its direction becomes a plain angle; the shape does not change). Includes 0.9.261 (inherit: parts stay still, taken lines clear).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.261

LEVEL7 design: «Inherit objects» with all parts shown — the parts no longer jump while lines are taken (nor when it ends); taken lines drawn bright green and thick, and counted in the bar.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.260

LEVEL7 design: F7 / F4 / F8 / F9 moved from the bar into the View menu (keys unchanged; the menu's Centre / Zoom / Refresh act on the design); fields in the windows readable with a light program theme and a dark drawing.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.259

LEVEL7 design: parts strip thumbnails clear — lines a fixed 1.3 px, pieces in blue, the active part in green, «فارغ» on an empty part.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.258

LEVEL7 design: joining two halves also links their lines that meet at the centre (hem, neck); notches drawn over the drawn lines (a notch along the centre line is seen whole).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.257

LEVEL7 design: linking lines across a half and its mirrored half makes them ONE piece (marker, cutter); mirroring a whole piece adds no second centre line; «Join pieces» works on halves already linked.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.256

Interface size (View menu): normal / large / extra large — the command bar and the parts strip larger and clearer; large from the start.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.255

LEVEL7 design: text letter weight in the text bar — bold, normal, thin, outline (less ink when printed).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.254

LEVEL7 design: Link tools next to a centre line — the hem / neck halves are taken, not the centre line between the halves.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.253

LEVEL7 design (review): linked lines keep what referred to them (stitches, pieces, daughter parts, Z measures); joined pieces drop notches on the shared edge; corner treatments follow a link; marker 2-3 × faster; text highlight only in the active part; main window: no blocked inline style.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.252

LEVEL7 design: with all parts shown, a text of another part can be chosen in the text bar (it takes you to that part), deleted, or double-clicked.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.251

LEVEL7 design: a corner inside one line (two lines linked at a corner) keeps its corner on the cut line (mitre), as two separate edges did.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.250

LEVEL7 design: no point panel with the text tool (the text goes where the click is).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.249

LEVEL7 design: Link tools — the pick dot and glow on the outer (cut) line too, nothing on the inner line.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.248

LEVEL7 design: text bar as GRAFIS — write / change / delete texts, heights 004 … 121 in one click, alignment, angle; a double-click on a text opens it in the bar.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.247

LEVEL7 design: the Link tools take and light a piece edge on its outer (cut) line, as GRAFIS; linking two edges of a piece keeps the piece whole.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.246

LEVEL7 design: a double-click on a text opens its own values (text, letter height, angle), also while a tool is on and when it is small; it is caught over its letters.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.245

LEVEL7 design: «Join pieces» (Link group) — two pieces (a half and its mirrored half) become one piece to cut and print; with a Link tool only the drawn line lights up.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.244

LEVEL7 design: parts strip «Open/close part list» button; the Parts window tool bar in two columns of larger icons in four groups (as GRAFIS), the window taller.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.243

LEVEL7 design: every part shows its grain line and details (stitches, symbols, texts) with all parts shown; Link says what it did and lights the result, and why a line is not taken.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.242

LEVEL7 design: all parts shown — side by side in one row (no second row), their seam allowance counted; F6 fits them all.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.241

LEVEL7 design: Space held + left drag moves the drawing in any direction (a Space tap is still zoom mode); link simple single takes only a line going on from the first one end to end.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.240

LEVEL7 design: Link tools as GRAFIS — link simple single, link simple chain, link (a gap closed straight or smoothly), link co-ordinated (the second line moved and turned onto the first one's end), change line direction.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.239

LEVEL7 design: Parts window preview — a production part shows its cut line and grain line; a stitch part also its sewing line dotted (not on edges with no seam allowance) and its notches.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.238

LEVEL7 design: marker making in the program — the pieces laid on the fabric in lanes by the parts' category (group 1 along the right selvedge, 2 beside it, 3 …), fabric width and gap, length and fabric use, then the cutter file (ISO / PLT); the AAMA file for another nesting program stays.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.237

LEVEL7 design: Parts window — «Marker and export» and «Stitch part» under Production part (as GRAFIS); a part with the marker off is left out of the marker; the parts table without a side scroll bar, its tool bar in three columns.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.236

LEVEL7 design: grain line drawn with the tool has a small open arrowhead (9 px at every zoom, at most a quarter of the line); its length is 50 mm by default (emptied, it follows the piece).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.235

LEVEL7 design: Parts window tool bar as GRAFIS — open / insert part, move up / down (Ctrl+↑/↓), duplicate (with daughter parts), delete, remove (renumbered), reduce, connection part, copy / print part list, edit name, save / load part module; inheritance follows every change.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.234

LEVEL7 design: Parts window as GRAFIS — fabric / amount / category only for a production part; a production part is checked for cutting / printing, its issues listed and marked on the preview (a click shows the place).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.233

LEVEL7 design: the Parts window's fields (amount, mirrored, category, part name) and the X / Z search boxes are readable in light and dark (typed text was light on white).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.232

LEVEL7 design: a curve end's handle dragged near 90° (up or down) to its line catches exactly 90° (within 5°; 0° / 180° too; with no line horizontal / vertical within 3°).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.231

LEVEL7 design: the part's fabric list is readable in light and dark, and its last item says «＋ إضافة اسم قماش…».

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.230

LEVEL7 design: curve bar «بلا بروز» (no bulge): the curve does not run past its ends' level where it heads towards them; the end directions are kept.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.229

LEVEL7 design: a part's fabric is chosen from a list (upper fabric, lining, fuse, template, paper, the product's fabric, names used; «أخرى…» adds one); no green name text on the pieces.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.228

LEVEL7 design: notch tool without the point panel, notches 3 mm by default; mirror takes the whole piece from its outer line also where a drawn edge lies close inside it. (With 0.9.227: grain line follows the part's size.)

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.227

LEVEL7 design: a grain line drawn with the grain tool and no length follows the part's size (to 90% of the way to the piece's edge, in every size); the mouse sets only its direction.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.226

LEVEL7 design: a part shows one grain line only: one drawn with the grain tool, or else the automatic one of its first piece (a mirrored copy gets none).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.225

LEVEL7 design: a sharp corner between a curve and the line it starts on holds at every value (it failed with «طرف … قصير جداً» and the two lines came apart when the value moving the curve changed).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.224

LEVEL7 design: deleting a line that another line was cut to keeps that line's present length (a curve on its end no longer jumps); the delete message names the steps that go and the lines that keep their length.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.223

LEVEL7 design: «نقطة منقولة باتجاه خط» follows the mouse already while the direction line is chosen, and the distance starts where the line was clicked.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.222

LEVEL7 design: inheriting lines from an earlier part works with all parts shown side by side: the lines are caught and marked where they are drawn.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.221

LEVEL7 design: the point panel (free / on a line / crossing / % / mm / x-y) stays inside the drawing and says what each choice is; a line starts at a known distance on another line with «mm».

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.220

LEVEL7 design: an AB point in a Z can be the crossing of two lines (no point there): an × shows under the pointer; the crossing follows the lines.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.219

LEVEL7 design: «hide line» hides what is clicked: the sewing line alone, or the cut line alone («إخفاء خط القص»); both only where they lie on each other (no seam allowance).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.218

LEVEL7 design: a line or curve double-clicked for editing is zoomed to: it fills the free part of the drawing beside its values window, under its bar.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.217

LEVEL7 design: curve bar «اتجاه تابع لخط»: click a point of the curve (an end or inside), then a line: the curve's direction there follows that line and keeps following it.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.216

LEVEL7 design: «hide line» also hides a line lying on the same spot (a mirrored piece's edge) and the piece's cut / fold line along that edge; no glow stays; the right-click menu follows the light / dark colours.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.215

LEVEL7 design: right click on a line (no tool open) opens a menu as GRAFIS: hide the line for a while (F5 or a test run shows it again), the seam allowance of a piece edge, show hidden lines, cancel.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.214

LEVEL7 design: AB / AL in Z give the value as drawn (what is clicked), on the part they were measured on, whichever part is open.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.213

LEVEL7 design: each part's history goes with the autosave too: the program opened again shows the last design with its history, and saving it keeps the whole history in the file (before, it was lost at restart and the next save wiped it from the file).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.212

LEVEL7 design: the notch tool takes a click on the piece's cut line (outer line) at any zoom: the edge glows, a mark shows where the notch goes, and the notch sits on the edge (linked to it), never on a loose point.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.211

LEVEL7 design: AB / AL in a Z formula (as GRAFIS): type AB or AL (or AL+AL+AL …), Enter, click the points / lines on the drawing, Enter keeps them; the value follows the drawing.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.210

LEVEL7 design: Z list buttons «إضافة Z» and «Z المميز»; X list columns «Abbreviation» (was MTM) and «القيمة» (was الأساسي); no library line above the X list.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.209

LEVEL7 design: no help text under the Z list.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.208

LEVEL7 design: X / Z windows follow the drawing area (dark / light); Z cards with column separators and a bolder type; the X list in the style of Z.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.207

LEVEL7 design: the Z number (the reference name) stands out — white on solid blue; no side scrollbar in the Z window.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.206

LEVEL7 design: each part's undo / redo history (up to 500 actions) is saved in the design file, compactly (each step once), and comes back when it is opened.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.205

LEVEL7 design: modern Z list — a card per Z (chip, bold description, formula with the X / Z it uses, value box), empty ones faded / hidden, search.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.204

LEVEL7 design: undo history per part; Record «اذهب إلى هنا» shows a part up to a step without deleting the later ones (saved per part), what is drawn goes in there, «إلى النهاية» shows all.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.203

LEVEL7 design: trim tool text «حدد الجزء الذي تريد قصه».

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.202

LEVEL7 design: trim cuts the part of the line that was clicked (either side of the base line); an extension still extends the nearer end.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.201

LEVEL7 design: a mirrored copy of a piece whose grain line was drawn by hand gets no automatic grain line; the delete-grain tool deletes the automatic one too.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.200

LEVEL7 design: the standard seam allowance (first field of the bar) is the design default: typing it changes every edge that follows it at once; an edge given its own value keeps it.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.199

LEVEL7 design: trim tool texts «حدد الخط الذي تريد قصه» then «حدد خط الأساس»; on the base line the part to be cut shows in red dashed with its length.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.198

LEVEL7 design: one rule for every tool that uses a piece cut line (it wins when the pointer is nearer to it than to a drawn line, at any zoom): mirror, seam allowance bar, glow, double-click; the drawn line of an edge with a seam allowance is dotted.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.197

LEVEL7 design: the seam allowance is edited in the top bar only: a double-click on a cut line chooses that edge (its value in the bar, ready to type), X / Z lists in the bar, every change applies at once (no window, no OK).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.196

LEVEL7 design: the cut line is taken by the pointer at any zoom (it wins over a farther sewing line within the pick distance); a double-click on an inherited piece edge opens its seam allowance.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.195

LEVEL7 design: the cut line of the edge under the pointer glows; a double-click on it opens that edge's seam allowance value at once (with any tool that does not use the cut line); the seam allowance bar takes an edge by its cut line too.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.194

LEVEL7 design: the start and end points of an active curve are dragged too (an end on a line slides along it, one value); development data follows LOCALAPPDATA when given (tests no longer share a restored design).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.193

MTM screens: styles written into the HTML (blocked by the window security policy, with warnings) moved to the stylesheet.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.192

LEVEL7 design: graded AAMA export works when the base size is switched off (the sample is the nearest active size); full review of all tools on a real design.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.191

LEVEL7 design: a size column is deleted from the X table itself (✕ on its header, asks first); a curve point tied to a line slides along that line (and its extension) when dragged, one value «مقدار الإزاحة على الخط» instead of X / Y offsets (Alt: free); the curve direction can be set at any point lying on the curve or any place on it; the double-click on a piece cut line opens the seam allowance bar also while a drawing tool is active; the mirror tools see a piece cut line (it lights up, a click mirrors the whole piece; a copy is a new piece with its seam allowance, notches and mirrored grain).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.190

LEVEL7 design: Ctrl+S saves the design back to its own file without asking; «حفظ التصميم باسم…» (File menu, Ctrl+Shift+S) asks where; a new design asks on its first save.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.189

LEVEL7 design: curve direction set / deleted at any of its points; a curve point on a line slides along it (Alt: free); after a drag the point's own value / X / Z fields; double-click on a piece's cut line opens the seam allowance bar; one fixed icon per tool group; inheriting no longer stops at a line already inherited lying on top.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.188

LEVEL7 design: cut-line corner square to an edge (new tool in the corners group); «مسافة الخياطة» instead of «الحاشية» everywhere; the cut line always keeps the full seam allowance from the sewing line (a broad random check found a case where it did not), with permanent random checks.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.187

LEVEL7 design: a click on a piece error of the test run lights up the piece's own edges in red; the message says clearly which piece and what to do; the piece tool no longer makes a piece whose edges do not close.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.186

LEVEL7 design: in the mirror bar a notch lights up under the pointer; new «notches only» mode (click a notch or frame several); the frame modes take a notch by its red mark on the cut line too.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.185

LEVEL7 design: a click on a test-run warning circles the bending curve end itself (an inherited curve no longer centres the view on an empty spot between the elements of its step).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.184

LEVEL7 design: the test run also warns (⚠, not an error) where a piece's seam allowance cannot come out clean — a curve end bending tighter than the allowance towards the cut side, or a very narrow corner — and a click shows the curve; the value of a new X / Z row is selected at once, so keys typed during a redraw replace its 0.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.183

LEVEL7 design: the cut line no longer kinks below a corner where a curve bends tighter than the seam allowance (the folded-back bit is cleaned off before the corner is found); «حذف خط اتجاه القماش» in the delete menu; the mirror tools mirror notches too and show a GRAFIS-style bar (single elements, points and lines / lines / lines through / points in a frame, a whole piece; copy or move).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.182

LEVEL7 design: a curve end angle sets the tangent line (as GRAFIS), so a curve no longer hooks at its end and the seam allowance runs parallel below the corner; folded pieces (fold edge chosen on the pieces page: no allowance on it, sewing line on the drawn half, fold dash-dotted, cut line and exports opened out); pieces in GRAFIS colours (blue cut line, solid sewing line, red notches, no fill).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.181

LEVEL7 design: clean seam-allowance corners where a curve bends tightly at the corner (no spike); the piece grain line stays inside the piece and gives way to a drawn one; F5 refreshes the screen; the number at a line / curve end names its line («L4 ▸ 1437.3»); the other parts' seam allowances show with them; a notch at the end of an inner line runs on along it, with its own length (mm or X / Z); round corner / chamfer on the cut (outer) line; background pictures moved and resized by hand, or fixed as the background of the whole screen.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.180

Full check after the recent updates: a damaged or hand-edited design file is set straight on opening (missing lists, active part out of range, next-id counter below an id in use); deleting a part drops its line types / colours; the values window of the active element follows changes made from its bar; digit tool shortcuts work with any keyboard language; dead code and unused styles removed.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.179

LEVEL7 design: with all parts shown, every part's dimensions show in its place (not only the active part's); F7 / Visibility → dimensions hides or shows them all.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.178

LEVEL7 design: the strip icons' tip shows only the tool's name; with all parts shown, the active part (the one being worked on) is drawn in its own colour (blue, as GRAFIS); another part under the pointer lights up orange.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.177

The old MDL workspace is hidden: no × to it, and the MDL-only commands (new MDL from template, X/Z example, show design, convert) are gone. Opening a GRAFIS file (GRAFIS button or File → Open) loads it in the background and converts its parts straight into a LEVEL7 design.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.176

LEVEL7 design: double-click on a curve shows its bar and handles together with its values window, which minimizes to its title (remembered) and follows handle drags; Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+S and the other letter shortcuts work with any keyboard language (Arabic too); the dimension bar keeps its unit (mm / cm / inch) and ×1 / ×2 / ×4 buttons when it stands vertical; the values window is above the tool bars; the strip icon's tip names the tool it shows; seam allowance and notch in a part with no piece start «piece from outline» and come back after it; grain line as GRAFIS: start point, direction in 90° steps (Shift: any angle) and length, one arrowhead; no teeth on the seam allowance where a curve meets a line.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.175

LEVEL7 design: a drag on a curve no longer adds a point by itself; points are added only with ➕ in the curve bar (then a click on the curve adds one there, and it can be dragged at once; right click ends).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.174

LEVEL7 design: the curve end handle under the pointer, and while it is dragged, stands out from the other one (larger, filled red, solid line).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.173

LEVEL7 design: the values window of a curve is short again: its direction and strength, plus only the point values set with X / Z or a formula (e.g. "start: distance = Z14"); no plain coordinates of dragged points and no unit / measured-from lists.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.172

LEVEL7 design: dimension bar: unit (mm / cm / inch) and ×1 / ×2 / ×4 as buttons in sight (the inch was hidden in a list); the tool bars (curve, dimension, seam allowance, inherit) follow the drawing background: dark with light writing on a dark drawing, light on a light one.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.171

The bottom bar shows the installed version ("الإصدار 0.9.171 · التحديثات · …").

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.170

LEVEL7 design: the values window of a curve also shows the points it passes through with the values they were made with (e.g. its start on a line at Z14, its end x / y), and which line an end direction is measured from.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.169

LEVEL7 design: test run / grade: a click on an error shows where it is (its part and size, the step zoomed with a red ring, or what it is built on when it could not be drawn; the piece; the Z table); dimensions: a click on a dimension makes it active and shows its bar: a note / name before the value, the text on the other side, text size, unit (mm / cm / inch) and ×2 / ×4, each one undo step.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.168

LEVEL7 design: a dark or light drawing background turns the line, curve and point colours that would not show on it readable, and the labels on the drawing follow it; corner (sharp / round / chamfer) where one line runs past the corner and the other stops short of it: one is cut back and the other extended to their meeting point, where it used to fail; a clear message when the chosen ends never meet.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.167

LEVEL7 design: the tool bars (curve, seam allowance, inherit) are moved anywhere on the drawing by their grip and turned vertical / horizontal with ⇅ (remembered; double-click on the grip puts them back); with no tool open, the dimension under the pointer glows itself (not the drawing line beside it), the cursor shows it can be moved, and a press drags it.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.166

LEVEL7 design: sharp / round / chamfer corner of two lines that already cross before their ends (often with a curve): the corner is that crossing and both are cut back to it, where it used to fail ("the corner is behind the start of a line"); test run / grade reports a Z only in the parts that use it (a Z measured from part 001's drawing is no longer an error in other parts).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.165

LEVEL7 design: Dimensions → length in one click: each click on a line or curve writes its length at once on the clicked side (the tool stays for the next one, right click ends); a right click anywhere (on the drawing or the program around it) closes the open window such as Visibility, without the ×.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.164

LEVEL7 design: the points of the active curve show as small dots; the square shows only on the point under the pointer and while it is dragged.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.163

LEVEL7 design: nothing on a line or curve reacts until it is double-clicked: no point squares when the pointer passes over a curve, points are dragged and the curve grabbed only on the curve made active by a double-click; a single click makes nothing active (it leaves the active element).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.162

LEVEL7 design: show all parts (as GRAFIS): every part drawn side by side in rows, in solid lines, not on top of each other; the part under the pointer lights up and a click switches to it where it is on the screen; hide all shows the active part alone. The eye of a single part still shows it faded in place behind the active one.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.161

LEVEL7 design: double-click opens the element that glows under the pointer (a point close beside a curve no longer takes it); double-click on a curve shows its handles, points and curve bar (as GRAFIS) instead of a window, and ✎ in the bar opens its values; an inherited element says which part it follows and is edited in.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.160

LEVEL7 design: a part shows only its own drawing; other parts show behind it only when their eye is switched on (or with show all parts), and are hidden again with hide all parts.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.159

LEVEL7 design (as GRAFIS): curve bar while a curve is selected: bind a point (a line end, a point or a place on a line: the curve passes through it and follows it), unbind, delete a point, end angle measured from a line (90°, 45° ...); line type (continuous, dashed, dotted, long dashed, short-long, dash-dot) and colour per line; mirror tools: axis, then copy / move, then each clicked element is mirrored at once, right click ends; inherit objects by clicking: the earlier parts show, the element under the pointer lights up, a click brings it into the active part (linked); seam allowance tool: standard, distance (3 values), unparallel (start / end), none, per clicked edge, values written on the edges; parts are visible unless hidden, with show all / hide all; no angle / % / length / name labels standing on the drawing (the angle shows while a handle is dragged).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.158

LEVEL7 design: a curve end handle moves freely in every direction (1°), whatever the angle step chosen for the line tools (it used to follow it, e.g. only up / down at 90°); Shift snaps it to 15°.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.157

LEVEL7 design: a click on a line or curve selects it and writes on the drawing the formulas it is built on (as GRAFIS): at its start the formula of the point it starts on (e.g. "Z17 name=65") and the angle of a line by angle, at its end its length or the formula of its end point, in the middle of a parallel its distance; also while the step is edited; a click on empty space clears it.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.156

LEVEL7 design: a curve is reshaped by grabbing the curve itself: dragging it adds a point there and moves it (also on a curve that has only its two ends); a click on a curve selects it; a right click (without dragging) leaves the curve editing.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.155

LEVEL7 design: the step window of a line also edits its start (and end) point made for it, e.g. how far down the line starts on the line it was drawn from; a point a curve passes through is dragged directly, without selecting the curve first (the curve under the pointer shows its points); Record has "back to here", which removes every later step (one Ctrl+Z brings them back).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.154

LEVEL7 design: Space = zoom mode (as GRAFIS): left click zooms in, right click zooms out, at the click (the point under the pointer stays in place); Space again or Esc leaves it; not while typing in a field.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.153

LEVEL7 design: choosing from the X or Z list beside a value replaces the field (it is added only after an operator typed on purpose, e.g. "X3/2+"); no suggestion arrow inside the value fields.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.152

LEVEL7 design: Shift held snaps to the nearest line end / point (within 60 px) and a click joins it, as GRAFIS. A click where the near mark sits on a line makes the point ON that line (linked), not a loose point beside it. Points that are only line ends are not drawn as separate dots. With a tool open, a click near a dimension is the tool's pick (the dimension is not dragged). Z window: formula and description columns look different.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.151

LEVEL7 design: the normal mouse arrow on the drawing (no cross); the near mark (pale yellow dot, as GRAFIS) shows from 30 px, on the nearest line / curve / point, and a click there picks that object.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.150

LEVEL7 design: as GRAFIS, the line / curve / point near the pointer is marked (a glow and a dot on its nearest point), always, not only while a tool waits for a pick. View (Alt+O) has colours for straight lines, curves, points, the near mark and the drawing background, kept on this computer, with a reset. Size page as the user drew it: all buttons in one fixed row above the table (no explanation text), the header row and code / name / base / grading fixed while the sizes scroll, English digits in every field. Fix: a fast first keystroke in a new X row is no longer lost.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.149

X table: X, name, MTM and the base size stay in place while the size columns scroll sideways (frozen like Excel); the header row stays on top. A library product takes its X values and sizes from Excel / CSV (same layout as the X table). Size names that are numbers (52, 54 ...) are read as size columns when importing X from Excel. Every small window (library, product, marker, ISO, product info ...) moves by its title bar.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.148

The program opens straight into LEVEL7 design (the last design, kept by the autosave). The GRAFIS (MDL) commands are one "GRAFIS" button in the design command bar: open an MDL, new MDL, the X/Z example, the MDL workspace; × still shows the MDL workspace. Design files now have their own extension .level7 (older .level7.json files still open from the program); on Windows .level7 files are associated with the program for the current user, show its icon, and open in it on a double-click, also while it is already running. All exports are one "Export" button (AAMA / PLT of the current size or all sizes, AAMA with grade rules + RUL, DXF). The measurement library can be managed from the size page: new products, their measurements and sizes, editing library products in the library itself.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.147

LEVEL7 design: new tool icons («linen + CAD»: linen tiles, red pins = points, blue thread = what the tool makes, blue cloth = pieces, red stitches, orange = measures, red cross = delete). Undo / redo and the history count are the drawing only; X / Z / sizes / unit are never changed by undo and add nothing to the count. Value fields have two lists, X and Z, instead of one mixed list. A tick above every size column (X table and size page) switches the size off: it stays out of the marker and the all-size exports until switched on. Command bar "Run": test run / grade the current part or all parts (Ctrl+Shift+6 / Ctrl+6), listing what fails per part and size. Measurement library (X window): the X tables of every model on this computer; a table is copied into the design, edits stay in the file, the library entry changes only with "update library"; a new design opens the library; export / import as a file. Command bar "Size" shows its role, with the current size and unit under it. Numbers in the size page are always English digits.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.146

LEVEL7 design: grading view as GRAFIS (command bar "Grading"): each click goes from all sizes stacked on each other (Stack) to all sizes side by side, in the rows and columns that show them largest, each in its colour with its name and width x height, then back to the current size. The current size stays editable in its place.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.145

LEVEL7 design screen: the cursor coordinates are no longer shown over the drawing.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.144

LEVEL7 design screen: no row over the drawing (size and unit are one command-bar button with a short list; the name is edited in Info); no status line under the drawing (the current step shows in the tool card); menus close on a click anywhere, also on the drawing; X / Z / Parts windows resize from every edge and corner, ▢ or a double-click on the title fills the screen; the X table has wider, clearly separated columns; Z descriptions wrap and grow; "Add formula" and the formula assistant are at the top of the Z window; Fit leaves room for the undo bar and the tool card. Windows: the exe of new builds carries the LEVEL7 icon, and existing desktop / Start-menu shortcuts are pointed at it on start.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.143

LEVEL7 design safety: unsaved work survives a restart or crash (autosave + an "unsaved" mark) and "New" / "Open" offer it back or ask to save it before replacing it; a design counts as saved only when the program confirms the file was written; undo copies keep each background picture once (a 3 MB scan no longer multiplies by 200); autosave falls back to keeping the design without picture data when storage is full, and says so; deleting an X that formulas use asks first; saving always includes the current part. A fixed 0.9.143 design file is now part of the tests so later versions keep opening today's files.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.142

The cutter-file window after nesting (command bar "ISO/PLT") also saves the nested marker as HPGL .plt: pen 1 the cut lines in the same order as the ISO file (cut-outs, notches, outline last), pen 2 sewing / grain / internal lines and a cross on each drill hole (optional), 40 units per mm, same origin as the ISO file.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.141

LEVEL7 design mode, command bar "ISO": cutter file in the ISO (Gerber ISO) format read by Bullmer, FK and Yin cutters, from a marker nested in another program and saved as AAMA / ASTM DXF (blocks with position, rotation, scale and mirror; LWPOLYLINE / POLYLINE / LINE / ARC / CIRCLE) or HPGL .plt. Metric 5.1 (G71, 0.1 mm), origin at the lower-left corner of the marker, one N block per piece: drill holes (M43) first, then internal cut-outs, notches as knife slits (optional), the outline last; knife M14 / M15, M0 at the end. Sewing, grain and internal lines are not cut.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.140

LEVEL7 design mode, command bar "Marker": one AAMA DXF for marker making with the pieces of every production part (Parts window), in the base size, every size and every MTM customer, with each piece's quantity times the part amount and mirrored copies marked (M). Parts without pieces are listed instead of being skipped silently.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.139

File > "Convert MDL parts to a LEVEL7 design": every part of the open MDL that has stored geometry becomes a part of a new LEVEL7 design, with its name, as fixed points, lines and curves of the base size (seam helper lines left out). The MDL file is not changed. All LEVEL7 tools work on the converted geometry; the converted elements are not parametric (they do not follow X / Z), new steps drawn on them are.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.138

LEVEL7 design mode: background pictures to trace over (add a photo / scan, place it in mm, transparency, calibrate from two clicked points and their real distance; F9 shows / hides); F8 writes the length of every line and curve on it; Arrange parts shows all parts as large pictures, a click opens one; the basic blocks library can be exported to a file and imported on another computer.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.137

LEVEL7 design mode: texts on the drawing (height, angle; {X1} / {Z3} show current values; double-click to edit); delete text by clicking it, and texts / inner symbols / stitches / notches inside a frame. View options: Visibility window (Alt+O: points, dimensions, stitches and symbols, texts, faded parts, pieces), F7 show / hide dimensions, F4 highlight duplicate objects. Product info printed to PDF (A4 sheet with texts, sizes, pictures and the part). Basic blocks library on this computer: save the active part as a block, inherit a block as a new part (adds the X / Z it needs). Convert notch: slit, T, V or castle, drawn and cut by the plotter in that shape.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.136

LEVEL7 design mode: Delete group (points, lines and curves by picking; points / lines / everything inside a frame); dependent steps and pieces are deleted with them after a confirmation; undo brings them back. Stitches group (lockstitch, double, zigzag, decorative, gather) along a line or curve on the clicked side at a distance; Symbols group (grain line, button, drill hole, cross). Parts strip with thumbnails on the left of the drawing (permanent / dynamic / off, eye per part, a click switches part). Product info window (name, article, version, variation, season, collection, product group, target audience, block reference, fabric name / type, subtitle, completion, author, comments, addition, sample size and size list, logo, two sketches and a fabric picture), kept in the design file. Not yet: deleting texts / inner / seam symbols, converting notches, printing the product info.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.135

LEVEL7 design mode: parts, as GRAFIS part organisation. A Parts window (button Parts, Ctrl+T): No | 👁 | name | RS | Obj | production, add / copy / delete a part, click a row to make it active, rename, draft or production part, fabric, amount normal / mirrored, category, last edit, and a preview. 👁 shows other parts faded behind the active one. Inheritance group: inherit chosen objects, or a whole part, from an earlier part; the copies stay linked to the source (they follow its changes and the X / Z values). Inheriting basic blocks from a library of other files is not available yet.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.134

Dimensions: drag a dimension closer to / farther from what it measures; double-click it to add text and put the value on the other side of the line; new sum dimension (Σ) of several lines and curves; unit switch mm / inch for dimension values (angles stay in degrees). Magnet: points attract the pointer from 18 px, a left click takes that point. Parallels of several lines and curves at once at one distance (number or X/Z), each on the side it was clicked; the parallel of a curve is a curve. Transformations group: mirror about an axis from point to point or a point and a direction, scale about a point (%) and scale along a direction (stretch), each as a copy or a move, values as numbers or X/Z.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.133

X values: import from Excel (.xlsx) or CSV and export to Excel (.xlsx) through the program's dialogs; columns are found by their headers (X, Name, MTM, Standard, sizes) or by content; existing X are updated, new ones added, size columns filled (a value equal to the base means "same as base"). Curves: every point a curve passes through can be dragged in any direction; a point tied to a line gets an offset (dx, dy) and stays tied to its line. Messages never block the drawing under them.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.132

X values laid out as GRAFIS: dense table X | Name | MTM | Standard (yellow) | one column per size (empty = base value), a tool bar (⊕ add, ✕ delete the selected row), search and copy (pastes into Excel). The angle step of live lines and the raster of free points are remembered until changed. After an operation is finished or a tool is closed, the point panel starts clean (values 0, plain point mode).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.131

LEVEL7 design mode: X and Z windows can be open at the same time (Z has its own window; both buttons light up). Excel-style Z formulas: IF (nested without limit), IFS (any number of conditions), AND, OR, NOT, MIN, MAX, SUM, AVERAGE, ROUND/ROUNDUP/ROUNDDOWN, INT, ABS, SQRT, POWER, MOD, SIN/COS/TAN/ASIN/ACOS/ATAN (degrees), PI, comparisons as 1/0, ^ and ; or , separators; the branch not taken is not evaluated. Z assistant: unlimited IF / ELSE IF rows, an "Excel formula" mode with a function list; only X values and Z rows before the current one may be used. Back arrow on the drawing with a list to go back several steps; the forward arrow appears after going back (as Excel). Curves: the handle distance sets the strength at that end (tension %), and the points a curve passes through can be dragged to reshape it.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.130

LEVEL7 design mode: no letters (P, L, C) on the drawing; the name shows only under the pointer. A right click anywhere closes an open tool menu. Curves as in GRAFIS: after a curve is made (or selected), each end has a handle with a dashed direction line and a red circle; drag it to set the direction at that end (live), double-click it to free the direction; the curve length is shown. New Dimensions group (as GRAFIS): aligned distance, horizontal, vertical, line/curve length and angle, placed with the mouse, drawn with arrows and values, kept up to date when the pattern changes (listed in Record). Fix: the sharp-corner and mirror-copy icons (lost in 0.9.122) are back; a second right click ends the curve tool.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.129

Z values rebuilt as in GRAFIS: a table Z | Formula | Text | Value with the formula first (a formula typed into the text field while the formula is 0 is moved to the formula); Enter saves and moves on; errors show in the value cell. Z value assistant, opened only on demand (ƒx on a row or "ƒx مساعد المعادلات" for the current row): formula or distinction of cases (IF / THEN / ELSE IF / ELSE, written as CMDIF), X and Z lists with names and values, logical and arithmetic operators. Point panel: an X / Z list beside the %, mm and x/y values (stays linked).

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.128

X table: the value field is a plain number field; it opens with its value selected, so typing replaces the 0 (1500, not 01500); Enter saves the value at once and moves to the same field of the next row; a new row puts the cursor in its value field. LEVEL7 design tool strip: left click on a group icon starts the last tool used in that group (or its first) at once; right click opens the group's menu to choose another tool.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.127

LEVEL7 design mode: the curve tool works in one go: click its points (existing or in empty space), a rubber curve follows the mouse, and Enter / right click / ✓ creates it (end directions can be set later by double-clicking the curve). New point panel, as in GRAFIS, shown while a tool waits for a point: existing or free point (with a raster step), point on a line where clicked, intersection of two lines, % of a line, mm along a line (numbers or X/Z formulas, from the nearer end), and x/y offset from an existing point (new linked step "point offset"); the panel can be dragged anywhere.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.126

Numbers always in English digits: every field in the program and in the LEVEL7 design engine is marked English, so values show as 480, not ٤٨٠, even with an Arabic Windows language; Arabic-Indic digits typed from the keyboard become 0-9 immediately.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.125

LEVEL7 design mode: the construction steps window is now "Record" (button Record · F5), opened only on demand, laid out like GRAFIS's list of interactive constructions: a table (RS, Name, details), a black preview of the pattern as it stood after the selected step with that step highlighted, and a bar with first / previous / ▶ next / last, edit and delete; arrow keys move through the steps, double-click a row to edit it. It opens wide by default; every window keeps its own place and size.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.124

LEVEL7 design mode: the steps / X / Z / pieces / sizes page is a floating window, hidden until its button in the command bar (F5, Ctrl+X, F11, Ctrl+G, Pieces) is pressed; drag it by its title bar anywhere, resize it from its corner, close it with × or by pressing its button again; position and size are remembered. The drawing uses the full width. Construction steps: cleaner rows with a number badge and edit/delete icons that appear on hover.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.123

LEVEL7 design mode: a right click (without dragging) confirms the step, a second one ends the tool; right-drag still pans. Double-click a line, curve or point to open its step with its values (angle, length, X/Z list) and change them. Measurements added while a value box is open are recognised at once (the box no longer reports "X2 not found"), and Arabic-Indic digits typed in the X table are read.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.122

Live drawing in every tool of the LEVEL7 design mode: the result is drawn in the live colour while the value box is open, and before the last click when hovering the final element (intersection, trim/extend, corners, lines). The mouse sets the value for parallel (distance and side), point on line, point moved along a line, line length, round corner radius and chamfer distance; values round to a step that suits the zoom; a typed value stays fixed; a click on the drawing or Enter confirms.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.121

LEVEL7 design mode, live drawing: "line by angle and length" follows the mouse from its start point with a dashed length circle and an angle/length label; angle step (free, 1, 5, 15, 45, 90°); typed values stay fixed; a click on the drawing or Enter confirms. "Line between two points" shows a rubber band with length and angle. Step card with picture, explanation, ✓ (confirm) and ‹ (back one step; removes a point the click created). Formula fields: an X / Z list beside each field (X1 = 1500 · name), suggestions while typing, lower-case x/z and Arabic-Indic digits accepted, and a clear message for a bare "X".

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.120

LEVEL7 design mode: tools live in a slim icon strip at the right edge; each icon (corner triangle) opens a flyout menu listing its tools by icon and name (points, lines, modify, curves, corners, pieces, measuring, export & save), and shows the last tool used. New corner tools: sharp corner (extend/trim both lines to their intersection), round corner (tangent arc of a given radius) and chamfer (straight cut at a given distance); all stay parametric and editable.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.119

LEVEL7 design mode: a command bar in the style of the program's toolbox, docked above the drawing, with the same shortcuts (Save Ctrl+S, fit F6, steps F5, X Ctrl+X, Z F11, sizes Ctrl+G, pieces, zoom −/+, Undo Ctrl+Z, Redo Ctrl+Y, New Ctrl+N, Open Ctrl+O, AAMA Ctrl+E, DXF, PLT); shortcuts also work while the drawing has focus. The engine's own page tabs are hidden (the bar switches pages). Drawing tools work on a blank page: a click in empty space where a point is expected creates a free point there. No grid squares on the drawing.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.118

LEVEL7 design mode: File > "تصميم LEVEL7 جديد" / "فتح تصميم LEVEL7…" opens the LEVEL7 parametric design engine (assets/l7design) over the work area. Its tools (points, lines, parallel, length, trim/extend, mirror, curves, pieces, notches, measuring) are driven by a palette drawn with the program's own icons; new designs are saved as LEVEL7 design files (.level7.json) and exported to DXF, DXF-AAMA (+RUL) and PLT through the program's save dialog. MDL files keep their existing path and are not converted.
X values of the New-N38 template now accept up to ±10000 mm (was ±1000), so measurements such as 1500 mm appear in the Line 10 length source list. X values that exist but cannot be a length (zero, negative, above 10000 mm) are listed greyed out with the reason instead of being hidden.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.117

Professional dark theme (default): dark panels, menus, command bar, dialogs and tables; tool icons are bright line glyphs on dark tiles (cyan, gold, mint, rose accents) with a cyan glow on hover and gold for the open group. View menu switches between dark and light; the choice is remembered on this computer.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.116

Speed: each document's part analysis and history replay are computed once and reused (documents never change; edits create a new document, and results are returned as copies). On ALAA2026.mdl opening went from 28.6 s to 2.1 s, six part switches from 72.8 s to 3.8 s and 30 zoom steps from 5.8 s to 2.0 s (software rendering). Geometry is unchanged: all 1299 objects still within 0.2 mm of GRAFIS.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.115

Newer GRAFIS files (MDL variant VB) now open with their stored drawings for viewing (read-only; editing and saving stay VA-only). Tool cards grow to use the free height of the right panel without a scrollbar, with two-line captions on large cards, tactile tile styling and fabric-filled pattern pieces in the icons.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.114

Compact tool panel: the right panel now fits the window without a scrollbar for every tool group (checked at 1280x720, 1366x768, 1440x900 and 1920x1080): four tool cards per row with one-line Arabic captions, tool cards in reading order, and smaller spacing on short screens. Delivered through the automatic update.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.113

Automatic updates: the program checks the LEVEL7 and MTM repository at start and every six hours, downloads only the changed application files, verifies each with SHA-256, and installs them after the next normal exit (documents and user data are never touched; a failed install restores the previous files). Status and a manual check are in the status bar. New interface theme: navy/gold title bar, card-style tool icons with Arabic captions, and a help card that names the tool under the pointer and says whether it is available. Commands, IDs and capability guards are unchanged.

LEVEL7 and MTM 0.9.112

Display name changes from LEVEL7 CAD to LEVEL7 and MTM, with a new icon (L7, tape-measure arc, MTM); the user-data folder keeps its old name so existing profiles remain. Redo is added (Edit menu, command bar, history panel, Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+Shift+Z) with the same part-link guard as Undo; any new edit clears it. Document commands (Save, Save As, Close, X/Z, part views) start disabled, so an empty workspace or the state right after Close never offers Save. The X window is narrower and its list grows with its rows instead of reserving a tall empty area. Double-click curve editing shows a single Apply/Cancel pair (the palette repeated the same handlers). Each Points and lines drawing option has its own title. Geometry fix: a tapered parallel (seam allowance) on a sampled curve now applies its first value at the end of the source path, as GRAFIS does; ALAA2026.mdl part 7 matches the GRAFIS-stored geometry within 0.0064 mm (was up to 2.5 mm). Round corner (EK_c004_02): trims up to 40 mm are now accepted (verified on right-angle GRAFIS test corners of 10/20/30/40 mm), and on curved sources the rounded curve is split on the ray from the intersection of the source tangents at the trim points; ALAA2026.mdl part 65 now replays fully and every object of the file is within 0.2 mm of the GRAFIS-stored geometry (part 65 worst 0.133 mm). Native MDL formats and link guards are unchanged. 22 broad Grafis option groups remain pending and further options are state- or scope-limited; full Grafis parity is not claimed.

LEVEL7 CAD0.9.111

Fixes fresh-drawing parameter-pool collision with local X: new interactive constructs reserve pool1, known previous-release Line10/Line20/Curve10 collisions relocate their native parameter payload without changing object identities or geometry, and unused scalars save without forcing a geometric change. Local X adds before, during and after native Line10/Line20/Curve10 drawing; pending endpoints, angle, length and tangents survive Add X and verified scalar edits. Supported independent native drawing parts can add, insert, duplicate, reorder and delete while linked histories retain protection. Menus are exclusive; File order follows the supplied Grafis reference with unavailable commands explicitly disabled. Save and Save As are distinct, current save targets are opaque native capabilities, external changes and junction redirection refuse replacement, Close resets the document and Exit uses the existing guarded native close flow. Direction palette is compact, movable and remembers its position; direction ray starts at the picked origin and displays an arc. Redundant Selection/Record/MDL-info footer, raw origin coordinates and status coordinates are removed from view; legacy curve numeric fields give way to the direct construction palette, and the X dialog is narrower. Existing bounded geometry/history/link families remain regression tested.22 broad Grafis option groups remain pending; full tool and interaction parity is not claimed.

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.70

Grafis-style grouped tools and floating Start/End construction palette for supported point/line drawing. Native straight-line percentage/distance references preserve IDs and modification propagation. Supported original shape, attribute, deletion, cut-mark, grain, parallel, separate and bounded link tools are included. Three controlled Grafis point-construction replay/save/return cases passed. Remaining Grafis tools, arbitrary native histories and full independent design geometry remain incomplete.

ربط نقطة المنحنى بمسافة: دابل كليك، ثم Bind point، واختر النقطة والمرجع. نوع الربط أصبح نسبة على المرجع، أو مسافة بالمليمتر من البداية، أو مسافة من النهاية. الربط بالمسافة متاح للخطوط المستقيمة الأصلية المعروفة. بعد المعاينة اضغط تطبيق ثم حفظ.

في Adjustment يمكن سحب الارتكاز الأوسط المرتبط بمسافة؛ تتحرك النقطة على مرجعها نفسه، ويُحدّث عدد المليمترات مع الاحتفاظ باتجاه القياس ومعرّف المرجع. لا يحوّل السحب الربط إلى نسبة أو إحداثيات ثابتة. يظهر نوع الربط والمقدار على الرسم، ويستمران بعد الحفظ وإعادة الفتح. Escape وإلغاء يحافظان على التصميم.

المسافات المرتبطة بمعامل Z لا تُحوَّل إلى قيمة حرة بالسحب. المسافات الحرفية على منحنى محسوب، والقيم خارج حدود الخط، والمراجع غير المفهومة تُرفض دون تعديل جزئي. تبقى خيارات الربط الأخرى ضمن نطاقها السابق. 146 فحص مصدر جديد، منها 59 فحص واجهة. كاتب الهندسة الأصلي، وحارس روابط البارتات، ونواة الحساب لم تتغير. لم يُجر تحقق جديد داخل Grafis؛ حفظ هندسة التصميم كله وجميع الأدوات المصورة ما زال غير مكتمل، وتبقى 10 سجلات بارتات متوقفة.

تحرير نقطة ارتكاز مرتبطة بالسحب: دابل كليك على المنحنى، ثم Adjustment. يظهر مقبض النقطة الوسطى ومرجعها بالأزرق. اسحب المقبض إلى الموضع المطلوب؛ تتحرك النقطة على مرجعها الأصلي وتُحدّث نسبة موضعها فيه، دون فك الربط أو تحويلها إلى إحداثيات ثابتة. عند إفلات المؤشر تُحسب معاينة المنحنى والبارتات التابعة، ثم تطبيق وحفظ.

Escape أثناء السحب، أو تغيير الأداة أو البارت، يلغي الحركة المعلقة. إلغاء يحافظ على الملف كله. يجب معاينة القيم العددية المكتوبة قبل بدء سحب جديد. السحب متاح للارتكاز الأوسط ذي مرجع النقطة النسبي المعروف فقط؛ بقية المراجع تستمر بأوامر الربط الصريحة ضمن نطاقها السابق. لا يُحرّك السحب نقطة مرجعية مستقلة أو يفك اتجاه المماس المرتبط.

حُفظ معرّف المرجع الأصلي، وانتقال التعديل إلى البارتات التابعة، ومتابعة النقطة لتغيّر المرجع بعد إعادة فتح الملف. 126 فحص مصدر جديد، منها 47 فحص واجهة. كاتب MDL وحراس الروابط ونواة الحساب محفوظة دون تعديل. لا يوجد تحقق جديد داخل Grafis. حفظ هندسة التصميم كله وجميع الأدوات المصورة ما زال غير مكتمل، وتبقى 10 سجلات بارتات متوقفة.

الدابل كليك على المنحنى يعرض أدوات Curve construction على الرسم. أُضيف Bind point لربط النقطة المساعدة الوسطى بنقطة أو خط أو منحنى محسوب سابق في الإنشاء، وإعادة اختيار المرجع. اختر النقطة ثم المرجع الأزرق على الرسم أو المرجع ونسبته من القائمة. Unbind point يحوّل الارتكاز الأوسط إلى نقطة مساعدة حرة، مع التحقق من بقاء موضعه ضمن 0.001 مم. إذا تعذر ذلك تُرفض العملية دون تحريك النقطة.

Direction start/final يعيد اتجاه الطرف إلى وتر البداية والنهاية، وDelete direction يجعله طبيعيًا عند بقاء اتجاه الطرف الآخر. احتُفظ بالمراجع الأصلية ومعرّفات العناصر وروابط البارتات. التعديل ينتقل عبر المراجع الحية؛ ويُحفظ تغيير المرجع حتى لو لم تتغير الإحداثيات. تظهر معاينة قبل تطبيق، وإلغاء يعيد الملف كاملًا.

الدابل كليك هو مدخل تحرير الخط والمنحنى: لوحة جانبية على العنصر المضغوط دون نافذة منبثقة، مع معاينة قبل وبعد على الرسم نفسه، وتطبيق أو إلغاء وEscape. يفتح تعريف التحكم الأصلي للمنحنى المدعوم، بما فيه التعريف الذي اندمج في مسار لاحق. المنحنى الموروث المعروف يصل إلى مصدره المسجل، ويعيد حساب البارتات المرتبطة دون فصل الروابط. عند وجود عدة تعريفات داخل مسار واحد يطلب اختيارًا صريحًا؛ لا يختار عنصرًا بديلًا.

أُخفيت أوامر النوافذ القديمة داخل أوامر إضافية للتوافق؛ لا يحتاجها التحرير بالدابل كليك. اختُبرت نقرات فعلية على مسارات رفيعة، ومعاينة الإزاحة، وتعديل تحكم المنحنى وحفظه وإعادة فتحه، وتعديل المنحنى المدمج039 وانتقال التغييرات إلى060و061، والتحرير من البارت الموروث060 مع بقاء مراجع مصدر039.

نجحت 9 اختبارات حماية و10 اختبارات واجهة للرسم والتعديل وحفظ القيم وإعادة الفتح. حافظ اختبار حفظ الرسم العددي المدعوم على كتل المراجع الـ102 كما هي. لا يُعاد ربط العناصر أو فصل البارتات. ترتيب التبعيات المحسوب خطة للفحص؛ لا يعني نجاح حساب كل الهندسة.

ما زال 48 بارتًا متوقفًا في ALAA، ولم يكتمل حفظ هندسة التصميم كله دون Grafis. هذا التحديث يحمي من تكرار حذف مراجع مطلوبة؛ لا يستعيد العناصر المفقودة بالفعل ولا يعالج كل مسببات الخطأ 223.

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.25

أُضيف حساب تغيير إزاحة طرفي الخط الموجود، والوصل حسب اتجاه كل مسار مع فجوات محدودة، وعلامات نهاية الخط باتجاه مطلق أو مماس، واختيار فرع تقاطع منفصل قرب الطرف. أُضيف مرجع النقطة الأصلية إلى قياس AB في Z. العمليات غير المفهومة والتقاطعات الملتبسة تبقى مرفوضة.

أصبحت سجلات البارتات 34 (44 خطوة) و36 (68) و43 (88) و45 (93) في تصميم ALAA بالحجم HN40 تُنفذ حتى النهاية. انخفضت السجلات المتوقفة من53 إلى49. قورنت جميع معرفات النقاط والخطوط في البارتات الأربعة على ست نسخ أصلية/محفوظة سابقًا (24 مقارنة بارت/ملف): انحراف المسار أقل من0.08مم والأطراف أقل من0.008مم؛ البارت36 أقل من0.002مم. لا تدخل الهندسة المحفوظة في الحساب.

نجحت77 مجموعة اختبار مصدر، وفحص31 تصميمًا/1334بارتًا دون تراجع في نطاق التنفيذ بالمقاسات الأساسية للفحص. تحققت الواجهة من وصول11 بارتًا مدعومًا إلى نهاية سجلاتها، وتغيير Z3 المحلي في البارت34 وحفظ نسخة معاملات وإعادة فتحها بنفس الحساب.

لم يكتمل حفظ هندسة التصميم كاملة بدون Grafis، ولا حذف X القديمة المرتبطة بالرسم، ولا التدريج الهندسي الآلي الكامل أو تحرير جميع المراجع الهندسية. نسخة المعاملات تحتفظ بالهندسة المخزنة القديمة؛ إعادة حساب التصميم الكامل داخل MDL ما زالت تحتاج Grafis. لم يجر اختبار فتح جديد في Grafis لهذا الإصدار. ملفات المستخدم الأصلية سليمة.

English: Adds bounded in-place endpoint offsets, explicitly oriented gap joins, endpoint notches, separated near-end connection branch selection, and point/endpoint AB measurement. Four additional ALAA HN40 histories execute fully:34,36,43,45. All their geometric IDs match24 comparisons against previously saved native files within0.08mm path/0.008mm endpoint tolerances. Source77 checks plus31-model/1334-part no-regression corpus. Full independent native geometry save and49 blocked ALAA histories remain incomplete. No new live native round-trip claimed.

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.24

أضيف عرض Interpolation إلى قائمة X مع فصل Global وActive part. الحساب يدعم المقاسات القياسية المعروفة في نظام 50-Werte-OPTIMASS: 35 هوية مقاس في أربعة أنواع جسم من كتالوج المقاسات المتاح. يستخدم الاستيفاء الخطي بين القيم والامتداد خارجها، ولا يخلط أنواع الجسم. المقاسات الفردية ومراجع X والأنظمة غير المفكوكة لا تُخمن. القيم المستوفاة تُستخدم أيضًا في حساب سجل البارت المدعوم؛ عرض القيم ليس تدريجًا هندسيًا كاملًا.

أُصلح الحفظ الرئيسي ليشمل تعديلات X/Z المطبقة. الإدخال غير المطبق يمنع الحفظ برسالة واضحة؛ إلغاء الحفظ يحافظ على التعديلات. يُمنع تعديل الرسم أو التراجع عنه أثناء وجود معاملات معلقة حتى تُحفظ النسخة وتُفتح، لمنع فقد المعاملات. الحفظ يحتفظ بالهندسة القديمة ولا يدعي إعادة حساب التصميم الكامل.

التحقق: 59 مجموعة اختبار مصدر، وفحص 31 تصميمًا / 1334 بارتًا دون تراجع في مدى التنفيذ؛ تقدّم السجل في 9 بارتات. ملف ALAA ما زال به 53 سجل بارت غير مكتمل. قواعد الاستيفاء مأخوذة من دليل Grafis المحلي ص155-156، ولم يجر اختبار مقارنة جديد داخل Grafis لهذا الإصدار.

ما زال ناقصًا: حذف X الأصلية المرتبطة بالإنشاء، التدريج الهندسي الآلي الكامل، تأليف المراجع الهندسية، بقية المنحنيات والعمليات التابعة، وحفظ هندسة التصميم كاملة بدون Grafis. ملفات المستخدم الأصلية لم تُعدّل.

English: Standard-size X interpolation for the verified 50-Werte-OPTIMASS catalog, separate local/global views, and staged X/Z handling through Main Save. No arbitrary size-name inference. Individual references and other catalogs remain unsupported. This is not full geometric grading or independent geometry saving. Existing histories with unsupported operations remain bounded prefixes. No new live native round-trip claimed.

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.23

أضيفت أوامر Add New X وDelete Last X وRemove Size إلى أعلى قائمة X. تعمل الإضافة على جداول VA المقروءة الموجودة، مع فصل Global وActive part، وترقيم متسلسل حتى X80 وحفظ القيمة الجديدة في نسخة MDL. إزالة المقاس تحافظ على Default. حذف آخر قيمة يدعم عكس الإضافات الجديدة غير المستخدمة في الجلسة؛ حذف القيم القديمة المرتبطة بسجل إنشاء لم يفك بالكامل يظل محجوبًا، وكذلك إنشاء جدول غائب. قالب N38 المباشر يحتفظ بمحرره المحدود X1/X2.

الدوال BTR وSQR وSIN وCOS وTAN وATN والثابت PI متاحة في مساعد Z ومحرك الحساب. الزوايا بالدرجات، والجذر السالب والظل غير المعرّف والقيم الخارجة عن الحدود تعطي خطأ صريحًا. إدراج الدالة يضع المؤشر داخل الأقواس. يدعم الحساب التركيبات المتداخلة وحالات CMDIF.

نجحت 51 مجموعة اختبار مصدر، تشمل الحساب والواجهة وحفظ X/Z وإعادة فتحها وحماية المراجع. فُحصت 31 تصميمًا تحتوي 1334 بارتًا دون تراجع في مدى تنفيذ السجل؛ لم يزد عدد البارتات المكتملة. لم يُتحقق من فتح ملفات التعديلات الجديدة في Grafis في هذا الإصدار. لم تتغير الملفات الأصلية.

ما زال غير مكتمل: الاستيفاء وفق نوع المقاس ومراجعه، التدريج الآلي، اختيار المراجع الهندسية، و53 سجل بارت في تصميم ALAA، وحفظ هندسة التصميم كاملة مستقلة عن Grafis. نسخ المعاملات تحتفظ بالهندسة المخزنة السابقة وتتطلب إعادة الحساب في Grafis. هذا الإصدار ليس إعلانًا عن المطابقة الكاملة.

English: Adds bounded existing-table X append/delete-last/remove-size with scope separation and reference protection. Adds six mathematical functions plus PI, degree trigonometry, bounded domain errors, nested expressions and CMDIF support. Existing construction-bound X deletion and absent-table creation remain unavailable. Mathematical and X-structure changes save to native parameter copies, retaining old geometry. Full independent geometry, interpolation, automatic grading and geometric-reference authoring remain incomplete. Source:51 checks plus a31-model/1334-part no-regression corpus. No new live Grafis round-trip is claimed.

Previous release notes:

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.22 — CMDIF case editor and X list actions

The Z formula assistant now offers Formula and Distinction of cases modes, IF/THEN, two optional ELSE IF/THEN branches, ELSE, and all six comparison operators. Existing root CMDIF expressions reopen as editable fields, including nested expressions. Mode switching preserves expressions; invalid/incomplete cases cannot be submitted. Elements insert into the focused field. Using a formula still stages it in the Z editor; Apply commits the parameter edit.

X lists support selection by index, copying visible values, saving a text report and exporting PDF. Scope and size filters are retained. Reports explicitly describe displayed values, which can include unapplied input; they are reports, not Grafis X-table import files.

24 checks passed:9 scalar/parser/native-copy groups,12 interface groups,3 engine-interface regression groups. Twelve existing native CMDIF definitions round-trip with unchanged syntax trees. Tests save/reopen a three-branch condition and X/Z parameter edits in separate MDLs. Geometry kernels and native writers are byte-identical to0.9.21; no additional parts are claimed complete.

Still incomplete: native X add/delete/remove-size, interpolation, automatic grading and successors, mathematical functions and geometric operand selection in the assistant,53 part histories and complete independent native geometry saving. Native parameter copies still require Grafis recalculation for full updated geometry. No new Grafis-open verification is claimed. Original designs remain unchanged.

Previous release notes:

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.21 — variable curve offsets, intersections and dependent parts

Adds variable offsets interpolated along computed path length, curve-to-curve trimming, reflection using a selected computed tangent segment, inherited grain markers, continued parallel groups, additional joins and four-object closed contour offsets. New groups validate all decoded fields and fail atomically on unsupported or ambiguous geometry. Calculations never use cached coordinates or per-model calibration.

Seven additional ALAA HN40 histories now execute completely: parts 7, 44, 61, 63, 64, 66 and 68. Every native point/line ID in those parts is independently computed; sampled paths agree with the stored reference within 0.08 mm and ordered endpoints within 0.008 mm. Ancillary dimensions/labels remain incomplete. Unfinished nonempty parts fall from 60 to 53; root part 2 still lacks 45 native objects despite reaching record 286.

133 source checks passed, including 24 UI checks. The separate 31-design / 1334-part corpus had no replay-coverage regression; its tested default sizes showed no additional completed prefixes. Parent X7/X18 edits recalculate the seven new histories. Cache deletion leaves their calculations identical. Parameter MDL copies retain 102 parts and recalculate identically after reopening. Saved native geometry caches are still unchanged: final Grafis recomputation is required. Full independent native geometry saving and general original-object canvas editing are NOT complete. No live Grafis round-trip is claimed for this release. Original user designs remain unchanged.

Remaining work includes EK corners, TO constructions, endpoint relocation, other join/intersection selectors and dependent operations, ancillary geometry, and a complete native geometry writer. The 53 incomplete parts and full-save restrictions remain explicit. Previous release notes:

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.20 — grouped X lists, compact Z table and additional dependent histories

X Values now separates Global and Active part, groups each parameter's sizes under its name, and provides size filtering, Edit Entry, keyboard navigation and short/edit views. Z Values uses a compact step/formula/text/value table with a formula assistant for supported arithmetic, conditions and real X/XG/Z references. Unsupported mathematical and geometric functions remain explicitly disabled; this is not complete Grafis interface parity.

The independent bounded history engine adds intersection and copied notches, computed-path distance anchors, collinear reflection axes, additional join and paired-offset records, and straight splitting at a computed path. Horizontal and vertical line creation now enforces its intended axis. ALAA HN40 histories 8, 9, 10, 39, 40, 41, 60 and 67 now execute completely; all their native point/line IDs are computed, with reference path deviation below 0.08 mm and endpoint deviation below 0.008 mm. Ancillary labels/dimensions are not fully reconstructed. Unfinished nonempty parts fall from 68 to 60. The root still has 45 native objects outside its calculation. These algorithms use history and current inputs without per-model calibration or cached geometry as calculation input.

123 source checks passed, including 24 UI checks. A separate corpus of 31 designs / 1334 parts had no replay-coverage regression and one improved prefix. Parent X edits recalculate the newly completed histories; X and Z parameter copies save and reopen with 102 parts and retained edited values. The MDL copy retains old native geometry caches and STILL REQUIRES final Grafis recomputation. Complete independent geometry saving, all original canvas editing and full Grafis compatibility are NOT implemented. No new live Grafis round-trip was claimed. Original user designs remain unchanged.

Remaining work includes EK corners, TO constructions, variable curve offsets, additional selectors and dependent operations, and the complete native geometry writer. Unknown operations remain explicit stops. This update improves the existing calculation preview, not unrestricted original-object editing.

Previous release notes:

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.19 — additional independent dependent-part operations

Adds bounded constant polyline offsets and paired straight offsets, computed endpoint connections, multi-record display-state groups, straight-line splitting, start extension, curve endpoint references, and the verified 100 mm FL grain-marker family. Calculations use history and current inputs, never cached coordinates or per-model calibration.

ALAA HN40 parts 12, 13 and 15 now execute all 55, 72 and 51 records. Every stored object in these three parts and its endpoint order matches the reference within 0.001 mm. Other supported offset/connection paths match within 0.001 mm; three sampled sleeve-top paths remain within 0.08 mm. Part 8 reaches 34 records, part 10 reaches 53, and part 39 reaches 47. The number of unfinished nonempty parts falls from 71 to 68. The root still has 45 native objects outside its calculation, despite executing 286 records.

110 source checks passed, including 19 UI checks. Across 31 designs and 1334 parts, no replay coverage regressed and 4 tested prefixes improved. Changing parent X6 recalculates the three newly completed child histories; a parameter MDL copy retains all 102 parts and reproduces those calculations after reopening. Native caches in that copy remain unchanged and still require final Grafis recomputation. Full independent design geometry saving and general original-object editing are NOT complete. No new Grafis execution was used or claimed for this release. Original user files were preserved.

Remaining unsupported families include EK corners, TO constructions, unequal curve offsets, other selectors and dependent operations, and a complete native geometry writer. Unknown operations remain explicit stops. The improvements are available in the existing bounded history preview; this release does not unlock unsupported canvas editing.

Previous release notes:

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.18 — additional dependent-part history operations

Adds bounded inherited-object deletion, curve endpoint measurement, curve arc-distance and midpoint selectors, shared-end connections, two-object path joining, and reflection about verified collinear joined axes. Computation uses history and current parameters, without a Grafis runtime or per-model lookup. Unverified curve-offset code remains research-only and is not packaged.

ALAA part3 now executes36/66 records, part7 33/76, part10 31/82 and part47 24/25. The root remains286/286 with142computed objects and45native-only objects outside replay. Only parts2 and37 have fully executed nonempty histories;71parts still stop. Corner constructions, variable offsets, further dependent operations and full native geometry saving remain incomplete.

100 source checks passed:10 new dependent-operation checks,14 root checks,15 previous-engine checks,42 regressions and19 UI cases. Four retained joins match saved native paths and endpoint order within0.007mm.31designs/1334parts show no coverage regression at their tested sizes, but no coverage gain in that corpus. Full root held-out native comparisons retain the previous tolerances. New native opening attempts, including a previously verified control file, did not complete; these are NOT counted as native compatibility proofs.

Parent X and child Z edits change the independently computed prefixes. Parameter-only MDL copies retain102parts and reproduce these calculations after reopening. Native geometry caches are preserved unchanged, and final native recomputation is STILL REQUIRED. Full independent original-design editing/saving has NOT been achieved. User originals remain unchanged. Earlier release notes follow:

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.17 — terminal curve extensions and remaining root history

Verified terminal-segment ray extensions resolve ALAA record 179. Added bounded connected cuts, absolute Z-bound line lengths, additional QQ endpoint directions, QS curve-end/midpoint selectors, continued parallel inputs, and point inheritance. A narrowly defined stored legacy Xn/ expression is read compatibly; newly authored malformed formulas remain rejected. No per-model calibration or Grafis runtime is used for calculation.

The ALAA root executes 286/286 records, producing 142 computed objects (138 visible). Forty-five native objects remain outside replay. Only two nonempty parts have fully executed histories; 71 parts still stop on unsupported operations, including dependent curves and offsets. Root completion is NOT full-design compatibility. Longer three-anchor geometry can still stop (tested X1=1400 stops at record141).

14 new engine checks,15 previous-engine checks,42 regressions,16 drawing/part UI cases and2 original-design parameter UI cases passed. Native intermediate saves verify the new extension/connection geometry within0.001mm. Base and held-out edited root point/line geometry compares within0.002mm; sampled curves compare within0.125mm, without claiming identical vertices. A31-design/1334-part corpus has5 improved parts and no replay-coverage loss.

X/Z parameter copies save and reopen with all102parts retained and identical computed root/selected-child results. They retain OLD native geometry caches and still require Grafis final recomputation. Full independent geometry editing and complete final MDL geometry saving remain unavailable. Original user files are unchanged. Combined UI testing stalled under low virtual-memory headroom; separate serial UI processes passed. General crash resolution is not claimed.

Earlier release notes follow and describe their respective versions:

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.16 — computed curve cuts and displacement

Adds QS distance displacement, construction sampling for additional three-anchor curves, computed curve/straight cuts, cut-axis switching, and inherited/reflected trimmed curves. The ALAA root reaches 178/286 records, producing 92 historical objects (88 visible), up from142/286. Record179 requests an intersection beyond the computed curve: extrapolation is unverified and remains blocked.66 dependent parts still await a complete parent history. General original geometry editing and full independent MDL geometry saving are NOT complete.

15 engine checks and18 source UI cases passed before packaging. Selected new geometry agrees with saved native final geometry within0.01mm. Seven additional three-anchor designs compare within0.08mm in both vertex-to-polyline directions; adaptive vertices are not identical. Across31 independent corpus designs/1334parts,7parts execute more history and none lose coverage. No per-model calibration or Grafis runtime is used. Tests remove all geometry caches, exercise signed displacement and rejected ambiguous intersections, save/reopen X/Z parameter edits, and propagate an edit to a trimmed curve in a bounded completed-parent fixture.

Parameter-MDL saving retains the existing geometry caches; full final-design recalculation still requires Grafis. The independent historical preview is partial. Native-style drawing saves are supported only within the previously verified authoring scope. User original files remain unchanged. Tests are run serially under constrained heap sizes; no general crash-resolution claim is made.

Earlier release notes follow (their record counts describe those releases):

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.15 — bounded curve-distance and intersection replay

Adds independently computed construction segments for three-anchor natural-start curves, arc-distance endpoints, absolute-start two-endpoint curves and straight-line intersection starts. Inherited supported curves retain their computed construction segments. The ALAA root now reaches 142/286 records, producing 73 historical objects (69 visible), previously 140/286. The next unsupported operation is record143, QS option9;66 dependent parts remain blocked. This release does not enable general original line/curve editing or complete independent MDL geometry saving.

Eleven new engine checks and18 UI cases passed. Two saved native designs were compared: construction vertices agree within0.003mm, and the new main curve within0.001mm. Tests remove all geometry caches, vary X/Z, save parameter copies and reopen them, and propagate a curve edit to a child in an isolated bounded fixture. The fixtures are evidence for the admitted operation families, not universal equivalence. No Grafis process was invoked for these calculations or tests.

Parameter-MDL copies preserve existing geometry caches and still require Grafis for final full-design recalculation. The computed partial preview must not be treated as a complete design. Initial UI attempts failed under system commit exhaustion (renderer OOM); the final source suite passed after the user closed other programs. No general crash-resolution claim is made.

Earlier release notes follow (their record counts describe those releases):

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.14 — straight-line editing

Line tools now provide a new length (extend/shorten), rotation about the start/end/center, and an independent mirror copy across a specified horizontal/vertical axis. Length and rotation modify supported editable point/reference lines on the selected part, updating connected lines sharing endpoints. Existing X/Z bindings are retained: a transform changing a bound coordinate refuses and directs the user to edit the parameter. Mirror copies use numeric coordinates and do not inherit source dependencies. Cached original straight lines may be copied but are not generally editable.

Seven geometry/binary checks and sixteen UI checks passed. Two independently saved MDL fixtures were opened, recalculated using Test run all, and saved in Grafis: geometry, identities and construction history matched exactly. Other part blocks and original opaque history are preserved by a literal-tail edit tested on part7 of a102-part file.

The full curve/original-history/dependent-part engine remains incomplete. ALAA reaches record140/286 and66 dependent parts remain blocked; this release does not change that boundary. No universal MDL compatibility or complete crash resolution is claimed.

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.13 — part workflow and native production properties

Add now immediately creates the next sequential part without asking for a name/number; Rename remains available. Canvas point IDs are hidden while selection and geometric references remain intact. Deleting the first, middle and last independent test part was checked by opening, replaying and saving the resulting two-part files in Grafis.

Part properties now read/write verified VA production records: Draft/Production, Marker/export, Stitch, material, normal/mirrored quantities (0–99 each) and calculated total. Last edit is read from the native record and updated on property Apply. Two native-verified category choices (-D and ID) plus clearing are offered; existing other categories are retained. Source style remains unavailable. This edits native metadata; it does not perform production contour validation or implement marker/nesting functions. A new MDL with lining,4normal+3mirrored,total7 and categoryID was opened and resaved in Grafis with matching values and unchanged geometry.

Nine binary/semantic checks,13 UI edit-save-reopen checks and4 native comparisons passed. A separate screenshot capture stalled under low system commit headroom; the final functional suite passed without additional captures. No blanket crash-resolution claim is made. Existing partial-engine limits from0.9.12 remain: ALAA record140/286,66 blocked dependent parts, incomplete original curve editing and independent geometry save.

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.12 — directed points and renderer recovery

Adds bounded straight-line intersections, Z-bound directed offsets and curve endpoint selection in native construction history. ALAA part002 now reaches record140/286, with71 calculated objects (67 visible), up from129/286. One independently varied native experiment validates the calculated parent and child geometry within0.001mm;20 native parent auxiliary objects remain unsupported. Analytic tests cover signed/reversed directions and invalid records. Editing Z60, saving a new parameter MDL and reopening reproduces the calculated line.

Renderer failure now offers explicit reload/close and local diagnostics, with crash uploads disabled. Six consecutive edit/save/reopen cycles and a deliberately crashed, saved test renderer exercise recovery. System commit exhaustion was observed in earlier tests; the root cause of every prior crash is NOT established and a blanket crash fix is NOT claimed.

This is a partial engine update. The full ALAA root still stops at record141,66 dependent parts remain blocked, and full original-line/curve editing and standalone MDL geometry saving remain unavailable. Parameter-only MDL copies still require Grafis recalculation. No model calibration or stored geometry is used by the new calculation.

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.11 — extended independent curve calculation

Adds bounded two-end QQ construction polylines, unique straight/curve intersections used by geometric Z, relative straight-line picks, and three-anchor curves with a natural endpoint. Changed X/Z inputs recalculate these supported original curves and propagate into a dependent part when its source history is fully supported. Four saved native experiments validate the computed geometry within 0.001 mm; parameter edits also save and reopen with identical independent calculations.

The full ALAA part002 now reaches record129/286, with67 computed objects (63 visible), up from115/286 and56 objects. This remains a historical prefix, not the final design. Native auxiliary objects and native polyline parity remain incomplete.66 dependent parts remain blocked by incomplete parent histories. Parameter-only MDL exports still require Grafis recalculation. General original-line/curve editing, all-part standalone replay and full MDL geometry saving are NOT complete.

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.10 — selected-part line Move / Copy

Select a supported part and use Move / Copy line. Move translates both known endpoints atomically, including connected literal lines, with one undo action. Copy creates independent numeric endpoints, including copies from supported original straight references. A move along an X/Z-bound axis is refused; movement along an unbound axis retains the binding. Copy is a numeric snapshot and does not retain parameter bindings.

Validation: 39 drawing/part UI checks, 52 regression checks, and 11 atomic move/copy checks including native MDL save/reopen and other-part isolation. The underlying literal record grammar retains the earlier 0.9.9 native replay validation; this release does not claim a new full Grafis replay comparison. Original opaque curves/history, multiple stored size caches and full independent recalculation remain incomplete. General original-line movement is unavailable.

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.9 — drawing on the selected part

Point, straight line, connected lines, rectangle, length/angle, parallel, perpendicular and midpoint now follow the selected supported imported part, including empty parts. No filename or part-number calibration is used. New literal endpoints can be edited after native MDL save/reopen, including files resaved in Grafis. Existing straight cached paths may be used as numerical references. These are numerical snapshots, not persistent geometric or X/Z constraints.

Native validation: 306 new objects across all 102 parts of the tested ALAA file were recalculated and saved in Grafis. All 1715 object geometries and 102 histories matched. A different five-part design and editing a Grafis-resaved file also passed. This is not universal format compatibility. Files with multiple stored size caches, unsupported metadata/counts or extreme display coordinates remain unavailable for drawing. Arbitrary original geometry, native curve authoring and full independent replay remain incomplete. Existing structural part commands remain limited to supported new N38 drawings.

LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.8: independent parts and numerical drawing tools

Add, insert, duplicate, rename, delete and move parts up/down in newly created supported N38 drawings (1–99 independent parts). Each part retains its own X1/X2 and Z1/Z2 bindings. Undo and native MDL save/reopen are supported. Names currently use 1–23 printable Latin characters. These structural commands deliberately refuse imported designs with unknown metadata or dependencies. A Grafis-resaved file may also become read-only for these commands.

New drawing tools: length/angle line, parallel offset, perpendicular to a reference line, and midpoint. These produce numerical geometry snapshots, not persistent parallel/perpendicular constraints. Existing supported drawing scopes still apply.

An actual three-part MDL produced by this version was opened, recalculated and saved in Grafis: all nine geometry objects matched outside opaque native handles; histories and X/Z tables remained exact. This verifies the tested independent-parts family, not arbitrary imported designs. Production properties, general native curves and full independent replay remain incomplete.

Drawing tools 0.9.7: two-corner rectangles (four native referenced lines, four shared corners, one undo), connected line drawing, live length/angle/dimension previews. Optional N38 endpoint X/Z bindings propagate through rectangle corners. Same bounded native drawing eligibility as0.9.6; no general existing-pattern editing or new curve authoring.

0.9.6 UI update: separate Global and Active part X lists, part selector, grouped part properties and direct X/Z actions. Engine unchanged from 0.9.5. Production-property decoding/editing remains unavailable.

# LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.6

Adds independently computed QQ direction selectors for a relative-start two-anchor curve ending along a supported natural-end curve, and a natural-start three-anchor curve ending along a straight line. Stored per-size result coordinates are ignored; editable size-dependent options remain guarded. The generic prefix reaches115/286 records in ALAA part2, with56 calculated objects (52 visible).

The new tangent family is verified against changed-size, changed-pick and changed-curvature native experiments. This remains historical preview, with parameter-only MDL save. Curve intersections, later construction steps and full independent MDL geometry remain incomplete; Grafis is still needed for complete design recalculation.

---

# LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.4

Extends independent historical replay with bounded natural/relative three-anchor curves, literal base shifts, one-natural-end two-anchor curves, curve reflection and curve inheritance from fully executed parents. State-4 straight lines remain available to construction but are hidden in the preview. ALAA part2 reaches101/286 records (50 calculated objects,46 visible); record102 needs a curve tangent selector.

This is still a partial engine. Editing X/Z and saving a new MDL preserves native parameters; complete geometry recalculation still requires Grafis. Sampled curves are not exported as native geometry or used for curve length/cut/offset operations. No model-name calibration or cached geometry is used by the prefix engine.

---

# LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.3

Generic VA X-table parsing now preserves the exact reserved empty terminal slot 81. QS replay supports direct local-X bindings, literal XY start points and fractional positions on straight lines. No filename, design hash or calibration lookup is used by these calculation paths. Unsupported operations continue to stop replay explicitly.

This is an incremental engine release, not complete independent Grafis compatibility. Parameter-only MDL copies still require Grafis recalculation and save. Historical previews never replace final cached geometry.

---

# LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.2

Includes the multi-anchor curve work below and lowers MDL snapshot memory during repeated calculation. Public inspection copies are allocated lazily; source isolation, validation and serialized output are preserved.

---

# LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.1

Adds bounded three-base-anchor QQ curves, relative auxiliary points, and a Z-bound endpoint distance. Edit part002 Z8 in its Z table and open the historical calculation preview to see the curve change. X changes propagate through the upstream geometry too.

ALAA part002 now executes54/286 records and produces23 objects. The next curve has unsupported point displacements, so dependent parts and complete editable geometry remain unfinished. Seven saved native experiments agree within0.001mm at native vertices, including an independent held-out Z70 prediction. Preview tessellation is not native polyline parity and is not used for downstream curve measurements/transforms or geometry export. Parameter-only MDL copies still require Grafis Test run all and Save.

---

# LEVEL7 CAD 0.9.0

F5 or All displays every part in separately fitted, labelled cells. Each eye toggles visibility; Active returns to the selected part. Search filters only the sidebar. View layout never changes native coordinates, file contents or calculation capability. Empty and unsupported previews are explicitly labelled. Main drawing operates in active-only view.

35 desktop behavior checks cover 102-part visibility, search, fit, selection, native save preservation and existing X/Z workflows. Calculation engines are unchanged from 0.8.9; full geometry, multi-anchor curves and dependent parts remain incomplete.

---

# LEVEL7 CAD 0.8.9

Adds bounded QQ two-endpoint curves and QS absolute-angle lines, including an angle supplied by Z. X/Z changes rebuild these objects from construction references, never cached geometry. The X and Z dialogs now offer a labelled historical-prefix preview for any part; unsupported histories show no fabricated elements.

ALAA part5 advances from4 to8 of98 construction records (7 objects, including1 curve), then stops at a curve-offset command. Part2 still stops before record54;66 dependent parts remain blocked. This is not a completed pattern engine. Parameter-only MDL export still requires Grafis Test run all and Save. Main Save does not write experimental geometry.

Validation: four isolated native curve replay/save fixtures, including reversed direction and changed dimensions/angles, agree within0.001mm at native vertices. A held-out Z-angle/length test reproduces native endpoint floats exactly. The preview uses independent curve sampling: native polyline identity, curve lengths/offsets/cuts, multi-anchor curves and full geometry saving are not verified. Size-dependent QQ options and unknown references fail closed.

# LEVEL7 CAD 0.8.8

Adds dependency-ordered straight-line inheritance. Sources must finish their complete supported histories before children can inherit. Edits invalidate the shared document calculation, including transitive parents. Missing sources, cycles, ambiguous groups and partial parent geometry fail closed. Results never use cached coordinates or claim full native compatibility. X/Z dialogs identify the upstream part and stopping record.

ALAA still has66 dependent parts blocked by incomplete source constructions; numerical coverage remains311/335. Curves and full replay are incomplete. Parameter exports still require Grafis Test run all and Save; historical prefixes do not replace the final canvas or MDL geometry.

# LEVEL7 CAD 0.8.7

Generic contiguous part-history evaluation feeds geometric AB/GL measurements back into scalar Z dependencies, without original-file hash or part-number gating. ALAA:311/335 numerical definitions;24 remain unavailable. Prefix geometry is historical only, never a final design or a geometry export. Curves, inherited-part geometry and full precision compatibility remain incomplete.

All-part parameter edits are saved using the X/Z table export button; main Save preserves original MDL. Reopen the new MDL in Grafis, Test run all (Ctrl+Shift+6), then save for complete geometry. Native differential check:four part5 lines agree within0.000016mm; four part2 measured Z values agree at one displayed decimal.

# LEVEL7 CAD 0.8.6

X tables and scalar Z formulas can now be edited directly for each part with a decoded VA layout. Changes survive part navigation and can be exported together to a NEW native MDL. Global X is shared, and each named/default size row is distinct. Previously exported files can be edited again. No existing destination is overwritten.

The scalar evaluator scans all 102 parts in the supplied ALAA model: 298 of 335 definitions can be evaluated arithmetically; 37 remain unavailable due to unresolved geometry or inputs. These counts are not a full native calculation or proof of native precision on every part. Opaque/geometric Z definitions remain noneditable.

Native testing: edits to global X, part002 X1/Z8 and parts003/005/006 Z survived Grafis Test run all and Save with all scalar parameter blocks intact. A redundant single-operand group, (95)+1, was rejected by Grafis; the writer now rejects it and accepts the verified 95+1 form.

Full curve construction, part dependencies and independent complete geometry are NOT implemented. After exporting: open the NEW MDL in Grafis, use Test run all (Ctrl+Shift+6), save, then reopen in LEVEL7. The workspace overlays 142/187 unchanged original cached elements in gray and 49 independently recalculated elements in cyan; 45 original elements cannot yet be drawn. The gray reference is not a recomputed pattern.

The following earlier notes describe narrower legacy workflows; the direct all-part parameter controls above supersede their part002-only editing scope.

LEVEL7 CAD 0.8.5

Parameter-only native MDL transfer for Grafis

Open the authenticated original ALAA2026, part002/base HN40, and XZ / Preview. Edit X3/X4/X7/X15 and arithmetic/CMDIF formulas Z33..Z50. LEVEL7 independently previews 49 point/straight objects and four measured Z values.

The new MDL for Grafis button writes the changed parameters into a NEW native MDL. Open it in Grafis, perform Test run all (Ctrl+Shift+6), then save. This is required: exported geometry caches remain the original geometry until Grafis recalculates curves and dependent parts. The exporter refuses every existing destination. Main Save does not include workspace changes.

Separate .level7.json experiment save/reopen and partial SVG export remain available. A Grafis-recalculated file can be viewed in LEVEL7, but the experiment editor still requires the authenticated original; retain the experiment project to continue editing its inputs.

Native verification covers four simultaneous X edits and a longer conditional Z38 formula, native replay/save and propagation into 37 parts. It does not establish arbitrary formula/design compatibility, independent full recalculation, grading or general original-pattern editing. The partial drawing is not a complete cutting pattern.

# LEVEL7 CAD 0.8.3

This release adds a bounded editing path for the exact supported ALAA2026/ALAA202622-copy family, part002 basic thobe, at its stored base size. The original file remains intact until Save As.

- Add absolute points with one canvas click, and straight segments with two free canvas clicks. No pre-created point or coordinate dialog is required. Optional numeric point entry is available.
- Select and edit newly added points; connected newly added straight lines update. Reuse newly added points, save/reopen native MDL and undo each drawing operation atomically. The limit is64 new objects (points plus lines).
- Original part002 geometry and construction remain read-only. Other parts, old-point reuse, curves, general X/Z formula editing, bindings, grading and execution of unknown history remain unsupported. The existing cached preview is partial.
- Part properties (Ctrl+T or Extras) opens a searchable real part inventory with native names, RS/Obj counts, mother markers, preview and activation. Material/type/quantity/category/parent/source/lock editing is not implemented; unknown properties are marked unavailable.
- Z Values (F11) uses a compact searchable formula/value/comment table with collapsed history. For the exact original ALAA part002 and its base size,96 values are captured native Grafis observations, not recalculated results. They invalidate after document edits. Generic files show stored definitions without invented values.
- Existing supported New-N38 drawing, bounded X1/X2/Z1/Z2 authoring and bindings remain available. General ALAA X/Z control is not complete.

Native original-Grafis validation rebuilt deliberately stale new geometry, tested all102parts, then closed/reopened and repeated full runs. Both literal additions and editing a new point with its dependent line preserved all3341 original records and1409 old geometries in the controlled tests. This does not establish full Grafis compatibility.

Run LEVEL7 CAD.exe with its accompanying files. Prepared local updates use the guarded versioned updater; no resident or internet auto-updater is included. The original installed Grafis is used for validation only, not a hidden runtime dependency.
